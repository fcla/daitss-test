higher than bulk hauling for the same distance.

        Hauling costs per box do not appear to be related to total volume

hauled. Hauling costs perhaps are affected more by the volume per truck owned,

and by average distance of haul as well as by tje proportion of box-fruit and

tangerines hauled.

        Most operators have stated that hauling costs are about equal for

oranges and grapefruit, but higher for tangerines because of the ligher

loading required.

        Picking and Hauling Costs Combined.--The last three columns in Table 1

show the average costs for the complete operation of moving of fruit from the

treat to the plant which included picking and hauling combined. This is ob-

tained by adding together the costs allocated to the separate services.

Oranges cost 56.77 cents per box, grapefruit 45.20 cents, and tangerines

$1.14 for picking and hauling to the plant.

        Many citrus firms, both dealers and packers, contract with other

operators to pick or haul, or both. Contract picking and hauling were

separated from the expense of the firm's own crews. Rates or amounts paid

contractors are not shown in Table I because of the difficulty of determining

the exact service performed and the kind of fruit.


                    Variation in Cost Among Firms

        Variations in total costs for picking and hauling in 1963-64 are shown

 in Tables 2, 3 and 4. Variations were extremely wide this season. Some of

 this is accounted for by the freeze in December 1962. The 1963-64 season is

 the first full fiscal period of operation since the freeze and some firms had

 much lower volume. In many cases the scattered fruit was more difficult to
