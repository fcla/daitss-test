23 firms with costs for 11 firms in the modal group between $1.08 and $1.27

per box (Table 4).


          Comparisons of 1963-64 Costs with Previous Seasons

        Total picking and hauling costs for 1963-64 increased substantially

over the preceding season (Table 5). Total picking costs for oranges averaged

9 percent higher, grapefruit 11 percent higherand tangerines 5 percent higher

than for 1962-63. Hauling costs increased by 6 percent. Total harvesting and

hauling costs increased over the preceding season by approximately 8 percent

for oranges, 10 percent for grapefruit and 5 percent for tangerines.

        The principal reason for the per box costs increases in 1963-64 was

the disastrous freeze in December 1962 which drastically reduced the volume of

fruit to be handled, and caused difficult operating conditions. The itemized

costs of the harvesting operation showed increases in every category of

expense.

        As compared with 1961-62, the last season of large-volume operation,

costs in 1963-64 were approximately 32 percent higher for hauling and 25 per-

cent higher for picking.

        Some of the season to season variation in cost for each service is due

to the firms included. They have not remained identical each year, and costs

vary widely among firms for providing the same service.

        Percentage changes in picking and hauling costs for 1963-64 compared

with 5 and 10 year earlier periods are shown in Table 6.
