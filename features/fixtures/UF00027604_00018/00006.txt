per box; and for grapefruit, for 27 firms 31.49 cents (Table 1.). Total pick-

ing costs for tangerines averaged $1.01 per box for 23 firms. Labor, including

workemen's compensation insurance and payroll taxes, was the largest item of

cost in picking fruit, being approximately 79 percent of the total for oranges,

80 percent for grapefruit, and 87 percent for tangerines.

        Hauling.--This operation refers to the transportation of fruit from the

roadside to the processing plant or fresh fruit packinghouse. It includes also

the hauling of packinghouse eliminations to the cannery, this being counted as

a separate haul. This is usually a somewhat less expensive haul than from grove

to plant, according to operators. One of the reasons for this is heavier load-

ing of trucks and the use of bulk handling methods for eliminated fruit. Haul-

ing, as used here, does not include the use of grove trucks, this being consid-

ered a part of the picking and loading operation.

        Citrus hauling costs for 30 firms with an average volume of 811,994

boxes were 13.74 cents per box for 1963-64 (Table 1). This is a composite cost'

for all kinds of fruit hauled and all types of operators. Labor costs includ,-

ing payroll taxes and workmen's compensation insurance were 32 percent of the

total, and other operating costs (fuel, repairs, licenses, depreciation,

insurance, rent) 59 percent. Administrative costs were about 9 percent of the

total.

        The distances over which the fruit was hauled are unknown, but citrus

 dealers and processors are believed to have had longer hauls than packinghouses

 hauling box-fruit. While costs do not vary directly with distance hauled,
