                             Introduction

        This is the 14th annual summary of costs of picking and hauling

citrus fruits, prepared from a sample of citrus dealers, packinghouses,

and processors. Other handling and marketing costs in the citrus indus-

try are released in spearate publications as indicated inside the back

cover.

        Costs of handling citrus fruits from the tree to the packinghouse

or processing plant for the 1963-64 season were summarized by type of

fruit for 30 firms. However, several firms did not pick fruit and sev-

eral others did not pick all the fruit hauled by their trucks. Seven of

the firms furnishing data were citrus dealers specializing in the pro-

curement, sale, and delivery of fruit to the processing plant, 21 were

principally packers of fresh fruit and 2 were processors. Most of the

dealers also contracted with other operators to pick and haul some of

their volume. Contracting with other operators to pick and haul part or

all of their volume also was common among the fresh packers and processors.
