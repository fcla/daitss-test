 County, 8; Lake County, 4; Indian River County, 2; and one each in Pinellas,

 Hillsborough, Pasco, Hernando, Highlands Counties.

        Total volume of fruit handled varied widely among firms. Because of

the effects of the 1962 freeze one firm had less than 30,000 boxes; 5 firms

picked more than 1,000,000 boxes and 6 firms hauled more than 1,000,000 boxes

each. The average volume for the 27 firms picking fruit was 692,118 boxes,

and for 30 firms hauling fruit 811,994 boxes.


                 Costs of Picking and Hauling, 1963-64

        The average costs per box for picking and hauling citrus fruit for

the 1963-64 season from the tree to the processor or packinghouse are shown

in Table 1. These costs are weighted averages; that is, the total money

costs of all firms were divided by the total number of boxes handled. In

prior years the costs for citrus dealers were shown separately to reflect

somewhat different methods of operation. The distinction between citrus

dealers, packers and processors in methods of picking and hauling is per-

haps not as clear as it once was. Packinghouses often pick and handle some

fruit destined for canneries by the bulk methods used by citrus dealers and

processors. A few packers also use bulk handling methods for the fruit which

is packed fresh.

        In some prior years a cost was estimated for the procurement and sale

of fruit by dealers. Because of the difficulty of arriving at a suitable

proration basis this has not been attempted in Table 1. Direct or identifi-

able procurement costs such as buyers' salaries or commissions have been

omitted. Certain other buying and selling costs as auto expense and tele-

phone have been distributed to picking and hauling expense.
